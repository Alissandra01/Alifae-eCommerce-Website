        hassle-free press-on nails.</h4>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <h4> Alifae Collections was born out of a shared love for nail art and a desire to make it accessible to everyone. 
        Our journey began in a small studio where our founder, Alissandra, meticulously crafted one-of-a-kind nail designs 
        for friends and family. Seeing the joy and confidence these custom nails brought to people's lives, she decided to turn 
        her passion into a brand. <br /> <br />
        In 2020, Alifae Collections officially launched, offering a curated selection of high-quality press-on nails 
        that blend innovation with artistry. Since then, our brand has grown, but our commitment to providing easy-to-use, 
        fashion-forward nail solutions remains unwavering.</h4>
